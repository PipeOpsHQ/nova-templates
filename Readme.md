## DEPRECATED

**This repository is now deprecated for our own terraform modules.**

#### Provisioner scripts for servers on AWS

This repository previously contained our provisioning scripts. Our goal was to include stable versions of the GCP implementations here too, with our runner programmatically picking from this script to provision servers on any cloud platform.

The HIPAA & PCIDSS folder served as a dedicated module for provisioning strictly compliant servers that meet regulatory requirements.
